## Introduction

What are the motivations for using the hooks API in React? This is an extensive
technical subject so I'll try to summarize some points.

When we use class components it is really complex to reuse
logic with state, we use
[render-props](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) and
[high-order components](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html)
to try to solve these cases but these patterns ended up forcing us to
to restructure the components, creating the famous
"[wrapper hell](https://miro.medium.com/max/958/1*SU5_ws88Kh_Oio_L4Myhvg.jpeg)"
of components.

Complex components become difficult to read when you have different methods
methods sharing logic, such as `componentDidMount` creating event listeners and
`componentWillUnmount` clearing these listeners. Code that deals with the same
and codes that are not related end up staying together.
together.

To understand the motivation more deeply I recommend the documentation itself:
https://pt-br.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html#motivation

## Class Component

Below is a typical React class component with state and using life cycle
of the life cycle.

```jsx
import React, { PureComponent } from 'react'

import './styles.css'

export default class Class extends PureComponent {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)

    this.state = {
      name: 'Zagatti',
      count: 0,
    }

    this.updateName = this.updateName.bind(this)
    this.increment = this.increment.bind(this)
    this.decrement = this.decrement.bind(this)
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    document.title = `${this.state.name}'s counter`
  }

  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    if (prevState.name !== this.state.name) {
      document.title = `${this.state.name}'s counter`
    }
  }

  increment() {
    this.setState((state) => {
      return { count: state.count + 1 }
    })
  }

  decrement() {
    this.setState((state) => {
      return { count: state.count - 1 }
    })
  }

  updateName(e) {
    this.setState({ name: e.target.value })
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div id="section">
        <div class="top">
          <label>Nome:</label>

          <input
            type="text"
            name="name"
            placeholder="Seu nome"
            value={this.state.name}
            onChange={this.updateName}
          />
        </div>

        <div class="buttons">
          <button onClick={this.decrement}>-</button>

          <span>{this.state.count}</span>

          <button onClick={this.increment}>+</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

`count` is the state that stores the value of the counter to be displayed.
`name` stores the value of the input that is displayed in the page title.
We use `componentDidMount` to load the first value into the page title
page title and `componentDidUpdate` to update when the input changes.
In addition to the life cycle components we have the `increment` and `decrement` functions
functions to change the counter. At the end of the component is the JSX inside the
method that will be rendered on the screen.

We note that the code gets verbose with lots of data in the constructor only
to link the functions to the class, so with the React updates it was
implemented a syntax without using the constructor using the
[arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)
available in ES6.

```jsx
import React, { PureComponent } from 'react'

import './styles.css'

export default class Class extends PureComponent {
  state = {
    name: 'Zagatti',
    count: 0,
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    document.title = `${this.state.name}'s counter`
  }

  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    if (prevState.name !== this.state.name) {
      document.title = `${this.state.name}'s counter`
    }
  }

  increment = () => {
    this.setState((state) => {
      return { count: state.count + 1 }
    })
  }

  decrement = () => {
    this.setState((state) => {
      return { count: state.count - 1 }
    })
  }

  updateName = (e) => {
    this.setState({ name: e.target.value })
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div id="section">
        <div class="top">
          <label>Name:</label>

          <input
            type="text"
            name="name"
            placeholder="Your name"
            value={this.state.name}
            onChange={this.updateName}
          />
        </div>

        <div class="buttons">
          <button onClick={this.decrement}>-</button>

          <span>{this.state.count}</span>

          <button onClick={this.increment}>+</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

This way we have already eliminated a few lines of code and made the
component more readable and without having to link each new function in the constructor.
But then, can using the hooks API make this code even more
more readable?

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect, memo } from 'react'

import './styles.css'

function Hooks() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('Zagatti')
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `${name}'s counter`
  }, [name])

  function increment() {
    setCount((state) => state + 1)
  }

  function decrement() {
    setCount((state) => state - 1)
  }

  function updateName(e) {
    setName(e.target.value)
  }

  return (
    <div id="section">
      <div class="top">
        <label>Nome:</label>

        <input
          type="text"
          name="name"
          placeholder="Seu nome"
          value={name}
          onChange={updateName}
        />
      </div>

      <div class="buttons">
        <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>

        <span>{count}</span>

        <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default memo(Hooks)
```

`useState`? `useEffect`? `memo`? Functions inside another function?

Hooks always start with the "use" nomenclature, and yes it is possible to create a
function inside another and easily use it in the component without the
of `this`.

useState` is used to declare a state, this function takes an initial value and
and returns an array, the first position being the current value of the state
and the second a function to update that value.

useEffect` is used to handle side-effects in functional components.
It receives a function that will be fired when the component is
rendered and as a second parameter an array of dependencies, if there is a
change in this dependency it will be fired again. It is possible to declare
multiple "effects" in the same component. This helps keep the responsibilities for each
responsibilities for each side effect, rather than creating conditional logic
logic in one method.

`memo` is a high order component similar to PureComponent used for
function components. Like PureComponent it superficially compares
changes in the props and unlike PureComponent it allows the component to
re-render when there is a change in the useState or useContext. It is possible to
pass a second parameter with a custom function that receives the
"previousProps" and "nextProps", remembering that PureComponent and memo exist
to optimize performance, don't rely on it to prevent a render, as it may
cause bugs.

## How do hooks work in the component?

In the new component, we apply the `useState` hook to declare two
variables: name and count. Both have respective functions to update them:
setName and setCount. Not using a single state in the form of an object with
multiple values.

We call `useEffect` to change the title of the page after rendering. A
dependency array is passed as a second parameter to ensure that the
side effect is triggered whenever the name is changed.

Similar to the class-based component, we use JSX to declare
DOM elements and events.

## Bonus

A widely used feature in React with class-based components is the
componentWillUnmount` to clean up event listeners and logic that may be
running in the background when the component is destroyed, in this case
we add a return with a function inside the useEffect, for example:

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(() => setCount(count + 1), 1000)
  return () => {
    clearInterval(interval)
  }
}, [count])
```

When we create methods in class components they are already memoized and will only be
be recreated if you change something that this method uses. The same thing happens with
variables created with logic outside of the `render` method.

For this React provides two new hooks for memoizing values (`useMemo`) and another for
memoize functions (`useCallback`) to help with performance.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect, memo } from 'react'

import './styles.css'

function Hooks() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('Zagatti')
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `${name}'s counter`
  }, [name])

  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    setCount((state) => state + 1)
  }, [])

  const decrement = useCallback(() => {
    setCount((state) => state - 1)
  }, [])

  const updateName = useCallback((e) => {
    setName(e.target.value)
  }, [])

  const greeting = useMemo(() => {
    return `Hello ${name}!!!`
  }, [name])

  return (
    <div id="section">
      <div class="top">
        {greeting}
        <label>Name:</label>

        <input
          type="text"
          name="name"
          placeholder="Your name"
          value={name}
          onChange={updateName}
        />
      </div>

      <div class="buttons">
        <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>

        <span>{count}</span>

        <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default memo(Hooks)
```

Preferably always use these hooks to create values and functions inside the components.
components, inside the functional component you should only have hooks and the JSX return.
from JSX.

Why use callback to get the old `count` value? Since setState
is not synchronous, it is recommended that you use a callback that takes the current
current value of the state to avoid side-effects.
To test this I have this example: https://codesandbox.io/s/setstatesafe-62pmg

## Creating our own Hook

Yes, it is possible to create your own Hooks by extracting logic from components.
Hooks can only be used inside components, but you can use them to create your own hooks.
to create your own hooks.

When we want to share logic between functions in Javascript, we create a
function with this responsibility. Components and Hooks are also functions,
so it works for them too.

To create a custom Hook we create a Javascript function with the name
starting with "use" and that uses other Hooks. As an example it abstracts the state
of count and the increment and decrement functions of the component.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react'

export default function useCount() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    setCount((state) => state + 1)
  }, [])

  const decrement = useCallback(() => {
    setCount((state) => state - 1)
  }, [])

  return { count, increment, decrement }
}
```

So far nothing new, a new function with count status and the functions
increment and decrement. The return of the function is an object with the state and the functions,
now let's see how it is used.

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect, memo } from 'react'

import useCount from '../hooks/useCount'

import './styles.css'

function Hooks() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('Zagatti')
  const { count, increment, decrement } = useCount()

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `${name}'s counter`
  }, [name])

  const updateName = useCallback((e) => {
    setName(e.target.value)
  }, [])

  const greeting = useMemo(() => {
    return `Hello ${name}!!!`
  }, [name])

  return (
    <div id="section">
      <div class="top">
        {greeting}
        <label>Name:</label>

        <input
          type="text"
          name="name"
          placeholder="Your name"
          value={name}
          onChange={updateName}
        />
      </div>

      <div class="buttons">
        <button onClick={decrement}>-</button>

        <span>{count}</span>

        <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default memo(Hooks)
```

Simply by receiving the return from the Hook useCount it is possible to use the state and
functions. If another page needs to use a counter now there is no need to
duplicate the logic throughout the application.

**Is this code the same as the original?** Yes, it was just extracted logic for a reusable
reusable function.

**Is it necessary to name Hooks with "use"?** It is not required, but do so.
With this convention React is able to check for violations in the Hooks rules.

**Do components that use this Hook share state?** No, each component will have its own state.
will have its own state, to share it you need to use
Context API, Redux, MobX, RecoilJS or another global state manager.

## Conclusion

Done! We have migrated a class-written component into a functional
component using the Hooks API. The way of developing in React with
Hooks may seem strange in the beginning but with time it becomes natural and
with more readable code. We also created a custom Hook separating the
component logic and making it reusable, the creation of custom Hooks is something that
is something that should be explored.

**But don't worry**, this doesn't mean you have to migrate all your existing code to the
existing code to the Hook API, but when it comes to creating new components it is something to
to consider.
