### TL;DR

I started posting content beyond the blog. So, follow my social networks on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/reactwayjs/) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@andre_zagatti), and if you are interested, sign up for the class about my training [at this link](https://reactway.com.br/inscrever).

Before starting at the internship, in my first opportunity in the programming area, I was already actively participating in communities on Discord, helping whenever possible, even if I didn't know the answer right away. I would research and make an effort to help the person with questions.

I realized that the best way to learn is by helping and teaching other people. O knowledge is much more fixed when shared in this way. I kept this pace for a couple of years, which resulted in a very strong technical foundation even after one or two years of experience. From there, I focused on keeping up to date and evolve other areas to progress to senior position.

## The blog

I always thought of other ways to share my knowledge, and the creation of this blog was the first idea that came up. Even if inconsistently, I feel very comfortable creating posts and sharing them here. At the end of the day, if I help at least one person, I'm happy.

I plan to better organize some content to create more detailed posts here on the blog. on the blog. I have already received compliments from some people about the posts, which encourages me and motivates me to keep the blog updated.

## Going further

I have imagined several times creating content for social networks, but I always procrastinated and left it for later. Just thinking about dividing time with something else, already discouraged me. discouraged me.

But the moment came when I decided to start, even if little by little, to produce these content. That's how [React Way](https://www.instagram.com/reactwayjs/) came about, where I intend to share smaller but relevant content, posting only what I consider really useful and important. In addition, I will better organize some content and start posting on my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@andre_zagatti), where the focus will be on medium and large size contents.

## My own training

For a long time, I participated in several communities, and I am still part of some groups. I always come across the difficult question: "Which course do you recommend?". In my career, I have had positive experiences with some courses, but I know that others people have different recommendations, making this question complex.

Motivated by the desire to share knowledge, to help answer this question, and question and considering my experience as a teacher on other platforms, I decided to create my own training, with the content I consider relevant and essential.

The training is still in development, but for those who already want to know more, I will do a live class on July 20, 2023, at 8pm, on my Youtube channel, explaining more about the project. To register in advance, just access [this link](https://reactway.com.br/inscrever).

## Conclusion

I am still at the beginning, but I hope that the content, whether free or in the training, can help many people to evolve and learn.

For those who do not wish to enroll in the training at this time, do not worry! Follow my social networks, because soon we will have even more content content to share.
