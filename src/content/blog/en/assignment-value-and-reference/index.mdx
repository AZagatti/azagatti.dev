## Data Types

When we assign a value to a variable, it can be a primitive value or a data structure.

#### Primitive values

The primitive values in JavaScript are: String, Number, Boolean, Null
(special primitive), undefined, and Symbol. These values are immutable, so when
we change a variable with any of these data types, a new reference in memory is
created, the same happens when we assign a variable to another.

```js
let value = 'Zagatti'
let newValue = value
```

In the example above, both variables are equal because they both contain a
primitive type that can be compared within JavaScript, but if we change either
of them, this change will not be reflected in the other.

This is what we can call assignment by value because the variables do not share
the same reference, being independent.

#### Non-primitive values

In JavaScript, we can say that non-primitive values encompass the types
[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)
and
[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Function),
which in the case of JavaScript, arrays, literal objects, Maps, etc., are of
type Object.

```js
const reference = { name: 'Zagatti' }
const newReference = { name: 'Zagatti' }

console.log(reference === newReference) // false
```

If we use the comparison operator between equal objects, we get a `false` as a
result because they are different objects, containing the same information
but having different references.

```js
const reference = { name: 'Zagatti' }
const newReference = reference

console.log(reference === newReference) // true
```

As we can see, the comparison operator returned `true`, because the comparison is
between the same object, which is what we can call assignment by reference.

This is the type of assignment that we should pay more attention and care to because
if we change the object through any of the variables, it will be reflected in the other.

```js
const reference = { name: 'Zagatti' }
const newReference = reference
newReference.name = 'Andre'

console.log(reference) // { name: 'Andre' }
```

There are many ways to create a new reference to the object, the most used is
with the spread introduced in ES6.

```js
const reference = { name: 'Zagatti' }
const newReference = { ...reference }
newReference.name = 'Andre'

console.log(reference) // { name: 'Zagatti' }
```

In daily life, we use a lot of arrays of objects, and in this case, it begins to
become more complex to take care of the reference because we can create a new
array with the spread, but we still have the same internal object references,
and it becomes more complex when we have even more levels in the object with
other objects.

```js
const reference = [{ name: 'Zagatti' }]
const newReference = [...reference]
newReference[0].name = 'Andre'

console.log(reference) // [{ name: 'Andre' }]
```

There are
[several ways to clone an array or object in JavaScript](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/728360/how-do-i-correctly-clone-a-javascript-object),
but I leave it up to you to read on the link or research more about it.

## Beware of mutability

In many cases, we create functions to manipulate arrays within JavaScript.
Therefore, we must be careful with certain methods that directly alter the array.
Instead, in most cases, it is preferable to use methods that generate and return
a new array or data.

```js
const array = [1, 2, 3]

function removeLastItem(arr) {
  arr.splice(-1, 1)
  return arr
}

const newArray = removeLastItem(array)

console.log(array) // [1, 2]
console.log(newArray) // [1, 2]
```

In many cases, we want to preserve the original value, so the example with `splice`
wouldn't work well. For the same operation, we have the `slice` method.

```js
const array = [1, 2, 3]

function removeLastItem(arr) {
  return arr.slice(null, -1)
}

const newArray = removeLastItem(array)

console.log(array) // [1, 2, 3]
console.log(newArray) // [1, 2]
```

The methods that mutate the array are: `copyWithin`, `fill`, `flat`, `pop`,
`push`, `reverse`, `shift`, `sort`, `splice`, and `unshift`. All the others
create a new data while keeping the original array intact.

## Conclusion

Understanding the different data types of a language is essential to work at a
high level. Without understanding the difference between assigning a value or a
reference to a variable, it becomes complex to understand the data flow of the
application and to predict data being changed in different contexts having the
same reference spread throughout the application.

It's not a difficult concept to understand, and I hope that at the end of this
post, you have understood how to create advantages in different contexts, mutating
or not your data structures.
