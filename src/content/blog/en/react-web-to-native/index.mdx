## Introduction

This post is intended to explain some differences between the world of
web and mobile development with React.

When we talk about React the first thing that comes to most people's minds is
is React in the web world, but in fact the React library is only for creating
not necessarily only for web, it can be used to create interfaces for mobile phones
for cell phones, Windows and even more recently for Mac.

## Similarities

Both use React, so concepts like `props`, `state`, `component`,
`lifecycle` and `hooks` hold true no matter what platform. We can also
use libraries that don't use browser-specific things, such as state
such as state managers.

```tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

const App: React.FC = (props) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState('')

  useEffect(() => {}, [])

  return (
    // UI
  )
}
```

Since we both use JSX, the above component is valid in both React web and React Native.

## Differences

### Elements

When we program for React on the web we use the HTML tags, such as `<div>`, `<p>`, `<input>` and other tags. In React Native we need to use native components like `<View>`, `<Text>`, `<TextInput>` and [other components](https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis).

Web:

```tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

const App: React.FC = (props) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState('')

  useEffect(() => {}, [])

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Native:

```tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'

const App: React.FC = (props) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState('')

  useEffect(() => {}, [])

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Hello World</Text>
    </View>
  )
}
```

Note: All text in React Native must be inside the `Text` component.

### Styles

When we talk about application styling we think of `css` and yes React Native
also uses `css` to style the application with a few less properties 
and some specific ones as well. Another big difference in styling in React Native 
is that we use a class exported from the package itself to create the styles.

Web:

```css
.main {
  margin-top: 10px;
  color: #fff;
  background-color: #0a0a0a;
}
```

```tsx
import React from 'react'

import './styles.css'

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="main">
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Native:

```ts
import { StyleSheet } from 'react-native'

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  main: {
    marginTop: 10,
    backgroundColor: '#0a0a0a',
  },
  text: {
    color: '#fff',
  },
})
```

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'

import styles from './styles.ts'

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.main}>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Hello World</Text>
    </View>
  )
}
```

With these examples we can take a closer look. While on the web we use `css`
in its traditional way, in React Native it is created inside an object, so
we use numbers instead of a value with `px` and the properties are in camelCase.
Another nice thing to note is that while on the web we have style inheritance
inheritance from parent element to child in React Native this doesn't exist, so to assign
a color directly to the text we have to create a new key with this attribute.

Remember that to standardize styling across platforms we can use
CSS in JS libraries like
[emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) and
[styled-components](https://styled-components.com/).

### Routing and Navigation

This is a more complex topic to explain, because there are some packages that are more
used to create routes in both platforms and some others that some people prefer.
people prefer, so I will explain based on what I use and what I see the community
use.

On the web today the most famous route package for React is
[react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start),
while in React Native the most famous package is
[react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/).

Web routing with react-router-dom (v5):

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { BrowserRouter, Switch, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom'

const About: React.FC = () => <h1>About</h1>

const Home: React.FC = () => <h1>Home</h1>

const App: React.FC = () => (
  <BrowserRouter>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Link to="/about">About</Link>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
    <Switch>
      <Route path="/about">
        <About />
      </Route>
      <Route path="/">
        <Home />
      </Route>
    </Switch>
  </BrowserRouter>
)
```

Routing in React Native with react-navigation:

```tsx
import 'react-native-gesture-handler'
import React from 'react'
import { View, Text } from 'react-native'
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native'
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack'

const HomeScreen: React.FC = () => (
  <View style={{ flex: 1, alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
    <Text>Home Screen</Text>
  </View>
)

const Stack = createStackNavigator()

const App: React.FC = () => (
  <NavigationContainer>
    <Stack.Navigator>
      <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
    </Stack.Navigator>
  </NavigationContainer>
)
```

### Platform-specific codes

As you might expect there are things specific to each platform that
that require us to study the platform in more depth beyond the technology of the framework.
As in the browser we have to worry about the final bundle of the project, SEO and we have
available APIs such as `windows`, `localStorage`, `DOM`, `WebRTC` and many others,
in the native development world there are also specific things like a
class called `Platform` to tell you what platform the application is running on,
`Animated` for creating animations, `Dimensions` for entering screen sizes, and
other peculiarities.

An interesting example to note in this post is that React Native already
provides a virtualized list that helps a lot in rendering various elements
when it comes to performance.

On the web we can show values from a list with a map:

```tsx
import React from 'react'

const users = [
  { id: 0, name: 'André Zagatti', age: 23 },
  { id: 1, name: 'John Doe', age: 26 },
  { id: 2, name: 'Fulano', age: 31 },
  { id: 3, name: 'Ciclano', age: 43 },
]

interface ItemListProps {
  name: string
  age: number
}

const ListItem: React.FC<ItemListProps> = ({ name, age }: ItemListProps) => (
  <li>
    <p>{name}</p>
    <p>{age}</p>
  </li>
)

const App: React.FC = () => (
  <ul>
    {users.map((user) => (
      <ListItem key={user.id} name={user.name} age={user.age} />
    ))}
  </ul>
)
```

In React Native we have a virtualized list component in the package itself:

```tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { View, Text, FlatList } from 'react-native'

const users = [
  { id: 0, name: 'André Zagatti', age: 23 },
  { id: 1, name: 'John Doe', age: 26 },
  { id: 2, name: 'Fulano', age: 31 },
  { id: 3, name: 'Ciclano', age: 43 },
]

interface ItemListProps {
  name: string
  age: number
}

const ListItem: React.FC<ItemListProps> = ({ name, age }: ItemListProps) => (
  <View>
    <Text>{name}</Text>
    <Text>{age}</Text>
  </View>
)

const App: React.FC = () => (
  <FlatList
    data={users}
    keyExtractor={(user) => user.id}
    renderItem={({ item: user }) => (
      <ListItem name={user.name} age={user.age} />
    )}
  />
)
```

## Conclusion

It is indeed possible to use the knowledge created by coding in one of the two
platforms to make projects for the other. I say from experience that
it is possible to work in both fields and develop sensational applications and
sensational applications and sites.

But one thing I can say is that being an expert in everything that exists in both
platforms is very difficult and takes time, even today things come up that surprise me and
things that surprise me and I have to go after answers, especially in the world of React Native
Native that is very delicate because it deals with different native codes in more than one platform
platform and different companies in the mobile world (Apple and Google).
