## The Basics

If you have been using JavaScript for a while you probably have already used asynchronous concepts
concepts, from the famous `setTimeout`/`setInterval`, `Promise`, `async`/`await`
and the like.

First I would like to point out how JavaScript works under the
to make it easier to understand what this asynchronicity is all about.

## Event Loop and Event Queue

For those who know a little more than the basics of JavaScript will have heard of the
famous Event Loop architecture.

The Event Loop is nothing more than a cyclical way of executing the actions we send to
JavaScript, so the process is only finished when there are no more events to be
events to be executed or for other reasons, such as an error that breaks this
queue. An example of code for the Event Loop would look something like this:

```js
while (queue.waitForMessage()) {
  queue.processNextMessage();
}
```

The Event Queue is nothing more than the queue that manages the order in which these
messages by the Event Loop, that is, if it is a queue, the first event 
that is executed is the first to arrive in the queue, so as we are dealing with a queue
and one message follows the other we call it synchronous code, since a message will only be
one message will only be processed after the other.

## Asynchronous events

Well, from what I commented before, the events all happen synchronously, so how were asynchronous events handled?
how were asynchronous events handled before we had high-level API's like `Promise` and
level APIs like `Promise` and `async`/`await`? There are several ways, and one of them is very
common to use in the browser, which is the standard `Observer`, where a `listener` is
listens for changes to a particular event. One example is the old API for
to make requests, the late `XMLHttpRequest`:

```js
const xmlHttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
xmlHttp.responseType = 'json';
const url = 'https://api.github.com/users/azagatti';
xmlHttp.onreadystatechange = () => {
  // other implementations
  console.log(xmlHttp.response);
};
xmlHttp.open('GET', url);
xmlHttp.send(null);
```

In this case we registered a function in the `onreadystatechange` property of the
with the `XMLHttpRequest` instance and then, when using `send` we get
return this data in the `response`, so all the logic for when the data is
received should be inside this function assigned to `onreadystatechange`.

Another classic example of asynchronous programming is `setTimeout`
(and `setInterval`), where the assigned function is executed after the given time,
but a classic exercise about this function, what is the order of execution of these
logs? ðŸ¤”

```js
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('1');
}, 0);
console.log('2');
```
The order of the logs is: 2 -> 1. This is because the `setTimeout` enters the asynchronous event queue.
events, even though the time entered is 0, the Event Queue will prioritize the
only then will the `setTimeout` function be executed.

## Promise

Promise" is a broader concept than the name implies, it is a promise to wait.
that must be expected. Since there are many ways to work with asynchronous,
one of the best known by JavaScript users is to work with `callback`.
There are many ways to use callbacks as well, but the most followed pattern in
in JavaScript is to send a success and a failure function to an asynchronous
method.

```js
function successCallback(result) {
  console.log('It succeeded with ' + result);
}

function failureCallback(error) {
  console.log('It failed with ' + error);
}

doSomething(successCallback, failureCallback);
```

Looking at it this way may seem simple, but when there are chained events that
we get a famous problem, known as `callback hell`.
callback hell

```js
a((resultFromA) => {
  b(resultFromA, (resultFromB) => {
    c(resultFromB, (resultFromC) => {
      d(resultFromC, (resultFromD) => {
        e(resultFromD, (resultFromE) => {
          f(resultFromE, (resultFromF) => {
            console.log(resultFromF)
          });
        });
      });
    });
  });
});
```

With the arrival of `Promise`, we're able to work more elegantly, there's still
there is still chaining, but we have advantages, such as the callback passed
will only be executed at the end of the current Event Loop execution cycle,
while the `Promise` does not depend on it. To get the result of a `Promise
we must use the `keyword` `then`.

```js
a().then((resultFromA) => {
  return b(resultFromA)
})
.then((resultFromB) => {
  return c(resultFromB)
})
.then((resultFromC) => {
  return d(resultFromC)
})
.then((resultFromD) => {
  return e(resultFromD)
})
.then((resultFromE) => {
  return f(resultFromE)
})
.then((resultFromF) => {
  console.log(resultFromF)
})
```

Obviously these examples have a lot of strings, which is not very common,
but when you have a case where you need too many strings, even ``Promise`` won't work.
won't even solve it, but at least it becomes more readable and safer to use.

### The Promise object

Above I showed you how a `Promise` is used, but to create one there are a few
one of them is using the global `Promise` object, inside this object
object, there are many useful methods for working with `Promise`s, but I will focus on the
but I will focus on the basics.

A `Promise` can be created with the `keyword` `new` where we pass a function that has
two functions in its parameters, `resolve` and `reject`. The `resolve` function returns
the data passed if the `Promise` is completed, while `reject` returns an error from this
`Promise`.

```js
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve(console.log('Initial'));
})
.then(() => {
  reject('Something failed');
  console.log('Do this');
})
.catch(() => {
  console.log('Do that');
})
.then(() => {
  console.log('Do this whatever happened before');
});
```

In the log it will appear: Initial -> Do that -> Do this whatever happened before.

## Evolving with async and await

There are many cases where using `then` to wait for a `Promise` starts to get
complex, creating several `closures` at different levels, so
implemented a `feature` in JavaScript where we can create a `Promise` from a common
from a regular function, rather than using the global object.

With the `keywords` `async` and `await` we can work imperatively
asynchronous programming as if it were synchronous.

```js
async function getGithubData() {
  return fetch('https://api.github.com/users/azagatti')
}
async function myPromise() {
  const response = await getGithubData()
  const data = await response.json()
  return data
}
console.log(await myPromise())
```

Normally it would not be possible to use `await` in a scope outside of a function
function with `async`, but recently a new `feature` came into `v8` (main JavaScript engine)
JavaScript engine), called [Top-level await](https://v8.dev/features/top-level-await),
so we can use `await` outside of `async` functions in newer
versions of browsers and servers that run `v8`.

Getting back to the point, as in the example shown, we can wait for asynchronous operations
and then run other synchronous processes, it generally helps to maintain
readability of the code and keep the code clean by creating new variables and
functions. Remember that whenever we add the prefix `async` to a
function, it automatically becomes a `Promise`, so when we use
we must use `then` or `await`, otherwise it will run and we won't get any
feedback, and there are cases where we really don't need it.

## Finishing

Finally, always use `return` if you are using `then` inside a
function with `async`, otherwise the compiler will just ignore it and run in background,
what I recommend is to choose one of the approaches to the case, either use `async`
together with `await` or `then`. I should also bring up another article about the methods
we can use with `Promise` since they are many and have many uses.
