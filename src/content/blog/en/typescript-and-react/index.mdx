## Typescript

[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a JavaScript superset that adds types.
adding types, some people call it a language, but it doesn't change the fact that all
code in Javascript is valid code in Typescript.

## Typesetting

Typesetting is what made Typescript so attractive. Javascript, by having dynamic
shines in the eyes of many devs, making it easy to get started in the language,
but when we fall into more complex cases and larger code bases this dynamic typing
dynamic typing ends up hindering the understanding of the code and not bringing reliability.

Now bringing practical examples, if we try to do something like:

```ts
let firstName = 'André'

firstName = 0
```

We'll get the error: `Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.(2322)`
even if you don't tell it that the variable `firstName` is a `string`, Typescript has
to infer the type, so when we try to reassign a `number`, the
the compiler generates a type error, making the variables more reliable.

## Complex Types

When we work with Javascript it is quite common to use `Arrays` and `Objects`.
For these cases there are several typing options, the most common being
[interface](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html) and
type aliases.

Using the previous example, you can create type aliases for the variable
``firstName`, stating that it can be assigned a number.

```ts
type NameOrYear = number | string

let firstName: NameOrYear = ``Andres''

firstName = 0
```

The declaration could be directly `let firstName: number | string = 'André'`
but using type aliases makes the typing clearer, more organized, and can be
reused.

Now speaking of the most used structure in JavaScript, which is the `Object`, we can
we can use the interfaces to have a reliability of what we expect in the variable
variable of that type.

```ts
interface PersonalInfos {
  name: string
  age: number
  hobbies: Array<string>
}

const zagatti: PersonalInfos = {}
```

Before I comment further on the code, I must make a parenthesis for the
of the `hobbies`. There are two ways to declare an array of types, being for example
`string[]` and as I declared `Array<string>`. These minus and plus signs mean
that the `Array` type expects a
[generics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html), which is nothing more
is just passing it a type to let it know what the structure of the array is, and it can
It can receive other types as an interface that defines an object.

After this parenthesis I have to say that the above code will cause an error (
`Type '{}' is missing the following properties from type 'PersonalInfos': name, age, hobbies(2739)`
), because the
Typescript compiler expects the variable `zagatti` to start with the fields
fields with the correct typeface, adjusting the initialization should be something
like:

```ts
const zagatti: PersonalInfos = {
  name: 'André',
  age: 23,
  hobbies: ['Programar', 'Tomar café'],
}
```

But there is also a way to force typing of the empty object (`Type Assertion`)
using the word `as`, so it would look like this:

```ts
const zagatti: PersonalInfos = {} as PersonalInfos
```

One point of caution is to use this type statement with care so that you don't end up
not trying to access values that don't exist and appear to exist because of the
`Type Assertion`.

We can also inform you that some fields are optional, and to do this we declare
the field with `?:`

```ts
interface PersonalInfos {
  name: string
  age?: number
  hobbies?: Array<string>
}

const zagatti: PersonalInfos = { name: 'André' }
```

This way there will be no error, because the compiler understands that only the
`name` key is expected when initializing a variable with type `PersonalInfos`.

I think I've got most of the basics down, but there is a lot more to this superscript.
Typescript, there is much more inside this superset, a feature
feature that I recommend you look at is the
[Utility Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html)
and all of its documentation.

## Typescript in React

In React we always look for reliability when passing `props` from one
component to another, so for a long time we used a package called
`prop-types` where we could define a type for the `props` that a component but
the reliability was only the errors that happened when the project was running,
Typescript went further by bringing in the errors at development time and also with the
Typescript has gone further with the reliability of types in `states`, external
functions, and much more.

Imagine a component that gets a name by `prop`, does a search and gets the
surname and age, in Javascript the component would look something like:

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'

export const Main = ({ name, children }) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState()

  useEffect(() => {
    // api call
    setData({
      lastName: 'Zagatti',
      age: 23,
    })
  }, [])

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{`${name} ${data?.lastName} - ${data?.age}`}</h1>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Looking at it this way it may seem a bit obvious that `name` is a `string`, `children`
are the child tags of the `Main` component and the state `data` has a `lastName`
and `age` fields, but when using the component it is not required to pass the prop
`name` causing a `undefined` screen, we can handle it with the `||` operator in h1
but there can be N problems with people not understanding which field expects what.

Now the same component declared with Typescript would look like this:

```tsx
import { ReactNode, useEffect, useState } from 'react'

interface Data {
  lastName: string
  age: number
}

interface MainProps {
  name: string
  children?: ReactNode
}

export const Main = ({ name, children }: MainProps) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState<Data>()

  useEffect(() => {
    // api call
    setData({
      lastName: 'Zagatti',
      age: 23,
    })
  }, [])

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{`${name} ${data?.lastName} - ${data?.age}`}</h1>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Hmm, more verbose correct?! Maybe so, but much clearer and more obvious than what to do
with the component, now if we use the component in another `.tsx` file and
and don't pass the prop `name` we get the type error
`Type '{}' is missing the following properties from type 'MainProps': name ts(2739)`
which is wonderful, we know that for the component to work as it did we need to
we need to pass the correct `props`, and we also have the intelligence in the development, the
IntelliSense.

Everything I showed before about Typescript also applies in the React context,
that is, if you try to assign an object with different fields to the `data` state
state, a type error will occur. Besides useState there are many other uses
of Typescript with parts of React, such as this Input component:

```tsx
import { ComponentType, InputHTMLAttributes } from 'react'
import { IconBaseProps } from 'react-icons'

import { Container } from './styles'

interface InputProps extends InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement> {
  isErrored?: boolean
  icon?: ComponentType<IconBaseProps>
}

export const Input = ({
  isErrored,
  icon: Icon,
  children,
  className,
  name,
  ...rest
}: InputProps) => {
  return (
    <Container className={className} isErrored={isErrored}>
      {Icon && <Icon size={20} />}
      {children}
      {!children && (
        <label htmlFor={name}>
          <input name={name} {...rest} />
        </label>
      )}
    </Container>
  )
}
```

It may seem complex at first, but an interface can extend an existing one
which in this case are the attributes of the `input` tag. With Typescript we have the
with Typescript we have the confidence to create complex components and be sure that all the data
for example the prop `Icon` which is an icon component from the `react-icons` library.

## Conclusion

At the end of this post I can only say that there is a much bigger world around
Typescript and its use in the frontend world, and in the past example in
React.

I recommend using Typescript as much as you can, there comes a time
that it becomes natural to work with this tool and there is no reason not to
not to use the features that this superset provides, one day or another you end up
edge case in the project that would be great if a type system was available in it.
type system was available in it.
