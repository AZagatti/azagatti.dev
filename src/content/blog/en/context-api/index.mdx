## What is Context API?

The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html">Context API</a> is a way to share data between components at different levels of an element tree, often used to avoid <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/prop-drilling">prop drilling</a> and even as a state manager.

The last case I mentioned about using Context as a state manager is controversial because for a long time Redux, MobX, and others dominated this area, and we used these state managers even when we didn't need them. However, one thing we should be careful about when using the Context API as a state manager is that any changes to any data will trigger a new render, even if the changed data is not specifically used.

## More about Context API

Firstly, depending on when you are reading this post, I recommend checking out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/20646">this Pull Request</a> in the React repository, where a way to consume only one data from the context is being implemented. I also recommend these articles by master <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://kentcdodds.com">Kent C. Dodds</a> on how to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-use-react-context-effectively">organize a Context file</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-optimize-your-context-value">how to optimize it</a>.

## How to use it efficiently

My definition of efficient is with a good API to use and has good performance regardless of the size of the application.

```tsx
import { createContext, ReactNode, useCallback, useState } from 'react'

interface CounterContextType {
  counter: number
  increment: () => void
  decrement: () => void
}

const counterContext = createContext<CounterContextType>(
  {} as CounterContextType
)

const CounterProvider = ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0)

  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    setCounter((c) => c + 1)
  }, [])

  const decrement = useCallback(() => {
    setCounter((c) => c - 1)
  }, [])

  return (
    <counterContext.Provider
      value={{
        counter,
        increment,
        decrement,
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </counterContext.Provider>
  )
}

export { CounterProvider, counterContext }
```

Normally we define a context like this, I'm going to use a very simple counter example, but let's imagine something on a larger scale.

To track the renders, I'm going to create a `hook` and use it in the components.

```tsx
import { useRef } from 'react'

export const useRenderCounter = (componentName: string) => {
  const renderCount = useRef(0)
  renderCount.current = renderCount.current + 1

  return (
    <>
      <h3>{`${componentName} have: ${renderCount.current} renders`}</h3>
      <hr />
    </>
  )
}
```

To see the new renders happening, I'm going to separate it into three components that use the above context.

```tsx
import { useContext } from 'react'

import { useRenderCounter } from '../hooks/useRenderCounter'
import { counterContext } from './ContextDefault'

export const ShowCounter = () => {
  const renderCount = useRenderCounter('ShowCounter')

  const { counter } = useContext(counterContext)

  return (
    <>
      <h2>Counter: {counter}</h2>
      {renderCount}
    </>
  )
}
```

```tsx
// ...same imports

export const IncrementCounter = () => {
  const renderCount = useRenderCounter('IncrementCounter')

  const { increment } = useContext(counterContext)

  return (
    <>
      <button type="button" onClick={increment}>
        Increment
      </button>
      {renderCount}
    </>
  )
}
```

```tsx
// ...same imports

export const DecrementCounter = () => {
  const renderCount = useRenderCounter('DecrementCounter')

  const { decrement } = useContext(counterContext)

  return (
    <>
      <button type="button" onClick={decrement}>
        Decrement
      </button>
      {renderCount}
    </>
  )
}
```

With the components created, we can centralize them and use the `Provider` created in the context file.

```tsx
import { CounterProvider } from './ContextDefault'

import { ShowCounter } from './ShowCounter'
import { IncrementCounter } from './IncrementCounter'
import { DecrementCounter } from './DecrementCounter'

export const MainDefaultContext = () => {
  return (
    <CounterProvider>
      <h1>Default Context</h1>
      <ShowCounter />
      <IncrementCounter />
      <DecrementCounter />
    </CounterProvider>
  )
}
```

Testing:

<iframe
  loading="lazy"
  class="lazyload"
  data-src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/context-default-nvxmm?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
  title="context-default"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>

You may have noticed that all components are re-rendered when the `counter` is updated, even though only the `ShowCounter` component uses the value.

In this case, we can use the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-optimize-your-context-value">optimization recommended by Kent</a> or the library I want to introduce in this article, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dai-shi/use-context-selector">use-context-selector</a>. While separating the value from the handler that updates it into different contexts works in many cases, this library is fantastic for using the Context API more comprehensively with a clean API.

## Using use-context-selector

The declaration of the context is not much different, it just changes that we use the function provided by the library.

```tsx
import { ReactNode, useCallback, useState } from 'react'
import { createContext } from 'use-context-selector'

interface CounterContextType {
  counter: number
  increment: () => void
  decrement: () => void
}

const counterContext = createContext<CounterContextType>(
  {} as CounterContextType
)

const CounterProvider = ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0)

  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    setCounter((c) => c + 1)
  }, [])

  const decrement = useCallback(() => {
    setCounter((c) => c - 1)
  }, [])

  return (
    <counterContext.Provider
      value={{
        counter,
        increment,
        decrement,
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </counterContext.Provider>
  )
}

export { CounterProvider, counterContext }
```

Now the biggest difference comes when we use the created Context. We can still consume the context with the `useContext` hook provided by the library, but the reason we are using it is the `useContextSelector` hook.

```tsx
import { useContextSelector } from 'use-context-selector'

import { counterContext } from './ContextSelector'
import { useRenderCounter } from '../hooks/useRenderCounter'

export const ShowCounter = () => {
  const renderCount = useRenderCounter('ShowCounter')

  const counter = useContextSelector(counterContext, ({ counter }) => counter)

  return (
    <>
      <h2>Counter: {counter}</h2>
      {renderCount}
    </>
  )
}
```

First, we pass the context that will be used and as a second parameter of the hook a `handler`, in this `handler` the parameter we receive is the value of the context itself, so I can destructure, do any processing and then return the value that I want for the component based on the values of the context, in this case I took the `counter` and just returned the value.

Example of changes that can be made considering there is a shopping cart in the context:

```tsx
const cartInfos = useContextSelector(myContext, ({ cart }) => {
  return {
    cart,
    cartAmount: cart.length,
    cartIsEmpty: !cart.length,
    isHavePotatoOnCart: cart.some((product) => product.name === 'Potato'),
  }
})
```

Because of this `hook` and the resources provided, I find it very interesting to use this library when we think about scaling an application using the Context API.

Now going back to the example, the other components to increment and decrement the `counter` will be the same as the previous ones, changing only the way we consume the value from the context.

```tsx
// ...same imports

export const IncrementCounter = () => {
  const renderCount = useRenderCounter('IncrementCounter')

  const increment = useContextSelector(
    counterContext,
    ({ increment }) => increment
  )

  return (
    <>
      <button type="button" onClick={increment}>
        Increment
      </button>
      {renderCount}
    </>
  )
}
```

```tsx
// ...same imports

export const DecrementCounter = () => {
  const renderCount = useRenderCounter('DecrementCounter')

  const decrement = useContextSelector(
    counterContext,
    ({ decrement }) => decrement
  )

  return (
    <>
      <button type="button" onClick={decrement}>
        Decrement
      </button>
      {renderCount}
    </>
  )
}
```

And now it's time to test it, does this hook provide only a more detailed way to consume context values or does it actually impact performance?

<iframe
  loading="lazy"
  class="lazyload"
  data-src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/context-selector-px64l?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark"
  title="context-selector"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>

Only the components that use the updated values are re-rendered!

Final version with both examples:

## Conclusion

Initially, the Context API was not recommended for managing the state of large applications, but looking at the future of that Pull Request, the optimizations mentioned by Kent and the library I showed, it is indeed possible to organize contexts and scale an application using only the Context API to manage these states.

And to conclude, I am not against any other library for managing states, lately I have been looking a lot at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://recoiljs.org">Recoil</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai">jotai</a>, both solve this issue of managing states in a clean way, with a neat API and easy to use. If you use GraphQL and Apollo client, I also recommend looking at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/local-state/reactive-variables/">Reactive Variables</a>, combined with the cache it is simply powerful.
